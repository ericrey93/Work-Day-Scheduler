# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description
I created a work time scheduler for anyone that might need more help organizing what they do throughout the day! Once in the website, you will see timeslots between 9am - 5pm and you can write down any reminders of things you need to do, and store them there to come back to whenever you need to

## Usage 
I have attached a link below that will take you the the Scheduler, and all you have to do is just type in any timebox whatever it is you need to write down!
