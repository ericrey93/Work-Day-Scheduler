# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description
I created a work time scheduler for anyone that might need more help organizing what they do throughout the day! Once in the website, you will see timeslots between 9am - 5pm and you can write down any reminders of things you need to do, and store them there to come back to whenever you need to

## Usage 
- Type in whatever it is you want in any timebox
- hit the save button on the right side of the specific timebox to save what is written down
- Each timebox has a specific background color based on time: 
-- grey for past hours
-- red for current hour
-- green for future hours

## Contribution
As a junior developer, I definitely struggled with properly using Jquery, and finding the aproppriate methods to make this function. So I wanted to thank the many developers who have examples of proper use of Jquery methods which helped me identify how and what methods to use to mesh them for this assignment!
